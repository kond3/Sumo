# Sumo Logic API
I developed this program during my first internship as a SOC Analyst, when, each time a new client (or tenant) was added to the Sumo Logic SIEM, all configuration were made "by hand" through the web interface. Using the API documentation at [Sumo API docs](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/api/) I developed this BASH program to automate some of these configurations, which allows you to replicate configurations from a previous tenant to a new one, choosing what type of resources you want to replicate, selecting some of them, and also changing them just before the update to the new tenant. I'm looking forward to improving its functionalities, if you want to contribute, take a look at the [tasklist](https://github.com/kond3/Sumo/issues/1)!

# Installation and usage
Program execution is quite straightforward, however some initial configurations are required. First, create an access ID - access key pair from Sumo Logic Web interface (`Administration` -> `Security` -> `Access Key`).

Once you have id and key, the actual configuration can start:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install curl jq cowsay

git clone https://github.com/kond3/Sumo.git
cd Sumo

export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
chmod 744 configure.sh dir.sh
chmod 744 script/*.sh
```
Then, to start the program just type:
```
configuration.sh
```

# Note

I chose BASH to do this project for two principal reasons:
1. üòé Its semplicity in hanlding json files with jq
2. üêß The nice tux interface of cowsay 

This program was developed on Ubuntu 22.04, and all the testing was done with this OS, however every Debian-based distro should work just fine.

# Delete

During the testing phase, I created a simple script to delete resources from a tentan. I want to include it to the repo as `delete_resource.sh` for everyone that can find it useful. It's usage is quite simple:
```
chmod 744 delete_resource.sh
delete_resource.sh <resource_name_1> [resource_name_2] ... [resource_name_n]
```
To make it work you just need to insert id-key pair inside the script.

**Note:** Resource names must match those used in `./api/import.txt`.
